#  Instacart Grocery Analysis
## Project Brief
The purpose of this project is to perform an initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Instacart’s sales data to uncover valuable insights that can drive better business decisions. As an online grocery platform, Instacart offers a wide range of products to its customers through a mobile app, generating large volumes of transactional data. This project focuses on identifying trends, customer behaviors, and product performance to help the company improve segmentation strategies, optimize product recommendations, and develop more targeted marketing campaigns.

By analyzing key metrics—such as purchase patterns by time, product categories, and customer segments—this project aims to help Instacart enhance customer engagement and operational efficiency. Additionally, market basket analysis will identify associations between frequently bought products, supporting personalized product recommendations and cross-sell opportunities.

Through the use of data analytics tools like Python, Pandas, Seaborn, and machine learning techniques (such as clustering algorithms and association rules mining), this analysis will generate actionable insights. These insights will empower Instacart to forecast demand more accurately, improve inventory management, and deliver a superior customer experience.

 ## Project Insights
#### Order Patterns

Identify the busiest days and hours to schedule ads during low-traffic periods.  
Analyze peak spending times to determine the best products to advertise at specific times of the day.  
#### Product Pricing & Popularity
